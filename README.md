# Prime Number Pattern Analyzer

An advanced tool for professionals and students to analyze and visualize prime number patterns, including distribution, gaps between primes, and twin prime occurrences within a specified numerical range.

This application is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring interactive charts powered by Recharts.

## Features

- **Prime Number Generation**: Utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently generate prime numbers up to 2,000,000.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Calculates total primes, prime density, largest gap, and counts twin prime pairs.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
    - **Prime Distribution Chart**: A bar chart showing how primes are distributed across different number ranges.
    - **Prime Gap Frequencies Chart**: A bar chart visualizing the frequency of different gap sizes between consecutive primes.
- **Twin Primes List**: Displays all twin prime pairs found within the specified range.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and modern user interface built with Tailwind CSS that works on all screen sizes.
- **Quick Presets**: Easily analyze common ranges (100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000) with a single click.
